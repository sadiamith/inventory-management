For client side rendering: 
on the console, please type "cd react_client" and then type "npm run start"

For spinning up the server 
on the console, please type "cd server" and then type "yarn develop" 


I have used headless cms strapi, for the backend. 
React, context API for the front-end and data propagation between the components
